# VVunitAlignerCode_DARLA
Script based originally on DARLA alignment that post-processing phonemes into vowel onset units
Script implemented by Leônidas Silva Jr., CH/UEPB, Brazil, based originally on 
"DARLA: Dartmouth Linguistic Automation. A suite of vowel formant extraction tools tailored to research questions in sociophonetics." 
This script post-processes phonemic-sized units returned by the original Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA), and Forced Alignment and Vowel Extraction (FAVE), into vowel onset-to-vowel onset units (phonetic syllables ). 
The script also chunks speech into higher prosodic units (chunks – CH). The new segmentation serves for the automatic extraction of metric and prosodic-acoustic parameters (see Silva Jr. & Barbosa’s, 2019, 2021, and Barbosa’s, 2020 scripts for the reference task).
So far, VVUnitAligner script is under adjustments of chunk segmentation. As far as new versions are available, they will be updated in our GitHub repository: <https://github.com/leonidasjr/VVunitAlignerCode_DARLA>.
